## Auth Module Overview

This module handles authentication and authorization, built upon JWT + Redis + RSA + RBAC.

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/images/rbac.svg" alt="FastAPI">
</div>

### Features Overview

- User login via username and password
- AccessToken / RefreshToken generation and validation
- Token refresh
- Token logout
- Encapsulated user info injection via dependency
- Environment-based restrictions (e.g., Debug-only features)
- RBAC access control model

### Password Encryption (RSA)

> You don't need to worry about Swagger UI being affected by RSA encryption — it uses an independent login flow, which only works in the `DEBUG` environment.

During login, the frontend encrypts the password using the RSA public key provided by the backend. The backend then decrypts it using the private key, ensuring that the password is never transmitted in plain text.

> It is recommended to configure the key pair via environment variables.
>
> The `DEBUG` environment supports dynamic key generation, but this is not recommended in production.
>
> Dynamic keys can lead to inconsistent behavior across multiple services or instances, especially in environments with load balancing or distributed caching (e.g., Redis).

### Token Description

- **AccessToken:** Short-lived, stored on the client, used for authenticating API requests
- **RefreshToken:** Long-lived, stored in Redis, used to refresh access tokens

> The RefreshToken embeds a unique `jti` (JWT ID) and `User-Agent` to ensure the refresh request originates from the same source.

### RBAC

- No need to manually define permission codes for each API endpoint; the system automatically generates and matches permission identifiers based on the endpoint path and HTTP method, achieving fully automated permission management.
- User permission data is stored in Redis as structured data and cached according to the access-token lifecycle, effectively reducing database lookups and greatly improving permission-check efficiency and overall system response speed.

### Core Dependencies

| 名称                    | 说明                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HeaderAccessTokenDep`  | Extracts the AccessToken from the request header       |
| `HeaderRefreshTokenDep` | Extracts the RefreshToken from the request header      |
| `HeaderUserAgentDep`    | Extracts the User-Agent from the request header        |
| `UserAccessJWTDep`      | Decodes the AccessToken and retrieves user information |
| `UserRefreshJWTDep`     | Decodes the RefreshToken and validates the User-Agent  |
| `AuthCrudDep`           | CRUD wrapper for user-related database operations      |
| `UserRefreshDep`        | Validates and retrieves user info via Redis + Database |
| `UserDBDep`             | Retrieves user information directly from the database  |
| `VerifyPermissionDep`   | Route-based User Access Permission Validation          |

### Route Summary

- `GET /keys/public`: Retrieve the RSA public key used for encrypting passwords
- `POST /login`: User login, returns both access_token and refresh_token
- `POST /token/refresh`: Refresh the token, requires refresh_token and User-Agent
- `POST /logout`: Logout, deletes the refresh token from Redis
- `GET /user/info`: Retrieve current user information
- `GET /router/backend`：Get Application Routes

### Redis Structure

- Stored Key: `auth:refresh:<{user_id}>:<{jti}>`
- Stored Value: A serialized RefreshToken object, including fields like `created_at`, `refresh_token`, and `user-agent`
- Stored Key: `auth:permission:<{user_id}>`
- Stored Value: Current user's permission code

> This structure is extensible — you can include IP address verification, device ID, platform identifier, restrict refresh sources, or implement multi-device login control strategies.

> All dependencies and logic are injected via type annotations and FastAPI’s dependency system, making them easy to reuse and extend.

## Websocket Socket.IO Server Wrapper with Dependency Injection

This module wraps socketio.AsyncServer, introducing a FastAPI-style dependency injection system. It automatically handles lifecycle management, parameter injection, validation error responses, and the injection of special parameters (such as SID and environ).

Compared to traditional event handling, you no longer need to manually extract data from args or manage dependency initialization and cleanup logic, significantly improving development efficiency and code readability.

### Features

- FastAPI-style dependency injection (supports Depends()) and is compatible with fastapi.Depends
- Supports asynchronous dependencies and generator dependencies (yield)
- Automatic lifecycle management with teardown registration
- Pydantic-based parameter validation with error messages returned via error events
- Injects special parameters like SID (session identifier) and environ (Socket.IO request context)
- Automatically parses incoming data into Pydantic models

### Example

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from src.websockets.server import AsyncServer
from src.websockets.params import Depends, SID

sio = AsyncServer()


# Define a Pydantic request model
class ChatMessage(BaseModel):
    text: str
    room: str


# Define a dependency (supports async/generator/sync)
async def get_current_user(sid: SID) -> str:
    return f"user_{sid[-4:]}"  # Simulate fetching user info from SID


# Register event with injected dependencies
@sio.on("chat.send")
async def handle_chat(message: ChatMessage, user: str = Depends(get_current_user)):
    print(f"[{user}] sends message to {message.room}: {message.text}")
    await sio.emit("chat.receive", {"user": user, "text": message.text}, room=message.room)
```

### Automatic Error Handling

The following errors are automatically handled and returned to the client via an error event:

- Parameter validation errors (via Pydantic)
- Type errors (e.g., non-dict input for events)

Error response format:

```json
{
  "code": 1007,
  "event": "chat.send",
  "message": "Data Validation Error.",
  "data": "xx field required"
}
```

Special Parameter Injection：

| Parameter | Description                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `SID`     | Current connection SID          |
| `Environ	` | Request context (e.g., headers) |

```python
from src.websockets.params import SID, Environ


@sio.event
async def connect(sid: SID, environ: Environ):
    print(f"SID: {sid}, UA: {environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT']}")
```

> environ is only available during the "connect" event.
>
> This behavior aligns with the Socket.IO design: environ contains HTTP handshake data, which is only passed during connect(sid, environ) and cannot be accessed in later events. To use environ in other events, you must cache it manually during connection.

## Celery

### DatabaseScheduler — Dynamic Database-based Scheduler

The custom `DatabaseScheduler` dynamically loads periodic tasks from the database, refreshing at configurable intervals:

- Works like `django-celery-beat` but framework-agnostic (built for FastAPI)
- Loads tasks periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds) without restarting workers
- Automatically merges with configuration-defined tasks
- Fully async compatible via `AsyncSession` and `asyncpg`

#### Example

```python
from src.core.config import settings
from src.queues.celery import Celery

REDIS_URL = str(settings.CELERY_REDIS_URL)
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://your_username:your_password@localhost:27017/your_database"

app = Celery("celery_app", broker=REDIS_URL, backend=REDIS_URL)
app.conf.update({"timezone": settings.CELERY_TIMEZONE, "database_url": DATABASE_URL, "refresh_interval": 60})

app.autodiscover_tasks(["src.queues.tasks"])
```

Run beat with: `celery -A "src.queues.app" beat -S "src.queues.scheduler:AsyncDatabaseScheduler" -l info`

### AsyncTask — Native Async Task Support

Our custom task base class auto-detects async def functions and handles execution:

- Automatically runs async def tasks in the proper event loop
- No need to manually distinguish between sync and async tasks
- Backward compatible with sync tasks

#### Example

```python
import asyncio
from src.queues.app import app

@app.task
async def run_async_task() -> None:
    print("async task start.")
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    print("async task done.")

```

Run worker with: `celery -A "src.queues.app" worker -l info`

### TypedCelery — IDE-Friendly Celery Wrapper

Enhances native Celery with improved type hinting and IDE integration:

- Refactored class definitions to return accurate types
- Enables smart autocomplete and error detection in IDEs like PyCharm or VSCode
- Greatly improves development speed and reduces bugs in large teams

#### Example 1

![celery-type-1](docs/images/celery-type-1.png)

#### Example 2

![celery-type-2](docs/images/celery-type-2.png)

#### Example 3

![celery-type-3](docs/images/celery-type-3.png)

> For more details, please refer to the source code in the `src.queues` directory, including task registration, scheduler implementation, and async task execution logic.
